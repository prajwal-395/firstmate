# tests/fm-agy-ladder-enforcement.test.sh - the regression for the agy model
# ladder gate.
#
# The captain's ladder used to be prose only, so obeying it depended on an agent
# remembering it. This suite pins the tooling that now refuses instead. It
# drives the decision library directly for the rule matrix, and the real
# bin/fm-spawn.sh for the part that actually matters: that the gate sits on the
# ordinary dispatch path and fires there, not just in a library nobody calls.
#
# The load-bearing contracts:
#   1. Descending past a rung that still has headroom is refused, and the reason
#      names the rung and the percentage it acted on.
#   2. Descending with NO evidence about a rung above is refused too. Absence is
#      not permission; descending is the move the policy constrains.
#   3. Opus 4.6 is refused at or below its 25% floor - the captain's reserved
#      quarter - wherever it sits on the ladder, while other models exhaust to 0.
#   4. The honest paths still launch: rung 1 with healthy quota, rung 1 with no
#      evidence at all (a fresh home must not be wedged), and a lower rung once
#      every rung above is recorded exhausted.
#   5. The override launches a refused request and SAYS SO. A silent override
#      would be worse than no gate.
#   6. Both spellings agy accepts resolve to the same rung, and a model the
#      ladder does not rank is allowed but reported.
#   7. Headroom is reserved for launches already in flight, so a burst just
#      above the floor cannot all clear it on one pre-burst reading.
#   8. The intake poll serves BOTH decisions the gate makes. Stale evidence did
#      not only fail the floor open - it also blocked every descent, because a
#      descent needs the rungs above PROVEN spent. One fresh poll answers every
#      rung, which is what keeps the ladder usable instead of pushing dispatch
#      off it onto a costlier model.
#   9. When the poll cannot answer, the gate still decides and says which
#      fallback it took: rung 1 launches, a descent does not.
