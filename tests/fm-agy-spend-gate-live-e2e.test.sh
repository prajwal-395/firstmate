# tests/fm-agy-spend-gate-live-e2e.test.sh - the LIVE guard for the agy
# point-of-spend gate's mechanism: what only the real harness can prove.
#
# tests/fm-agy-spend-gate.test.sh pins the verdict logic against fixtures with
# no harness, so CI enforces it everywhere. It cannot notice the things that
# would silently break the mechanism in production: agy not firing
# PostInvocation, not honouring terminate, or breaking a healthy turn when the
# hook answers. This guard proves those three against the agy actually
# installed, in a disposable Herdr lab session, on the cheapest rung only.
#
# It is opt-in and on demand because it spends real quota on a real account and
# standard CI has neither the binary nor the credentials. Run it after every
# agy upgrade, and refresh docs/verification/agy-spend-gate.md from what it
# prints. Never point it at Opus: the reserve this gate protects must never be
# spent by its own guard.
#
# What it proves, end to end:
#   1. PostInvocation fires after a tool batch, with a payload carrying the
#      workspace the hook can resolve.
#   2. Answering {} lets a tool-using turn finish untouched (the gate must
#      never break correct output).
#   3. Answering terminate stops the loop after the in-flight batch, and Stop
#      fires afterwards (the gate can end the spend it exists to end).
#
# A missing agy, herdr, or jq is reported and skipped, never passed over
# silently: a guard that checked nothing must not look like a guard that passed.
