#!/usr/bin/env bash
# tests/fm-agy-harness.test.sh - the portable regression for the agy
# (Antigravity CLI) crewmate/scout adapter.
#
# agy's identity and composer checks are HARNESS-DEPENDENT: their verdicts come
# from what the vendor emits (an env marker, a process name, a drawn composer).
# This suite pins the LOGIC with real processes and real captures and NO agy
# installed, so CI enforces it everywhere; the live-harness guard in
# tests/fm-harness-liveness-drift-live-e2e.test.sh is what catches vendor drift
# against a real agy. Neither replaces the other.
#
# The load-bearing contracts:
#   1. agy's env marker is tested LAST, because the Antigravity terminal leaks
#      it into non-agy workers; it must never outrank an unambiguous marker.
#   2. Ancestry matches the exact command name `agy`, never a substring, so an
#      unrelated command cannot be misread as this harness.
#   3. agy's composer is a `>` prompt row between two `─` rules. It reads empty
#      or pending WITHOUT any agent-identity capability, while pi's blank
#      separated region - the same rule pair with no glyph - still needs one.
#   4. The dead-shell rule survives: a `>` prompt with no rule beneath it is
#      never `empty`, on any capability shape.
#   5. Both model spellings agy accepts resolve against its catalogue, a model
#      absent from it is refused, and the probe - a network call made while the
#      spawn holds two locks - can never block indefinitely, and carries none of
#      the caller's pane identity into the headless agy session it runs.
#   6. agy runs every task kind, because it has a supervision protocol and a
#      blocking primary Stop guard; muse still refuses a secondmate.
