#!/usr/bin/env bash
# tests/fm-progress-probe-live-e2e.test.sh - the live guard for the one thing
# about supervision's progress measurement that only a real harness can answer
# (live-harness-optin family).
#
# The measurement itself is a kernel fact and needs no vendor cooperation. What
# IS a vendor fact is where each harness's own two states fall against the
# threshold, and it is a fact that a release can change:
#
#   IDLE at an empty composer must measure BELOW FM_PROGRESS_CPU_MIN_PCT, or the
#   `stalled` verdict is unreachable for that harness and a worker stopped by a
#   provider session limit goes back to being invisible - a TUI that repaints a
#   clock or a spinner while idle is all it would take.
#   MID-TURN must measure AT OR ABOVE it, or the `progressing` verdict is
#   unreachable and every long turn goes back to being escalated as a wedge.
#
# Both are measured here against every INSTALLED verified harness, on real panes,
# and the guard fails naming the harness and its version. An absent harness is
# reported explicitly rather than passed over silently, and a run that measured
# nothing fails rather than passing vacuously.
#
# It submits one prompt per harness and therefore spends model tokens, which is
# why it is opt-in. Run it after every harness upgrade, and refresh
# docs/verification/supervision.md "Progress probe" from its output.
#
# Isolation: every Herdr call goes through bin/fm-herdr-lab.sh's named
# non-default lab session, which records the live default session before
# provisioning and requires an identical fleet state after teardown.

# The measurement span each direction is given here. Short by production
# standards on purpose, and conservative in the direction that matters: the
# threshold is a RATE, so a short window is the NOISIER one - a repaint or a
# background tick is a larger fraction of 45 seconds than of the 180 and 600 the
# library actually uses. An idle harness that stays under the threshold here
# stays under it over a production span; a working one that clears it here clears
# it there. The guard is asking where a harness's two states sit relative to the
# threshold, not re-deriving the spans.
