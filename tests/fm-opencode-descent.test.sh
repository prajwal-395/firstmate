# Behavior tests for bin/fm-opencode-descent-lib.sh - the running-worker half
# of the opencode free-then-Go ladder.
#
# The dispatch gate (bin/fm-opencode-ladder-lib.sh) routes the NEXT spawn; it
# never looks at a lane again. A lane that starts on free and hits the cap
# mid-run sits in a vendor retry backoff for hours doing nothing, which the
# supervisor reads as working. This evaluation re-checks RUNNING lanes against
# the same cap evidence the dispatch gate uses and moves the honest ones.
#
# The load-bearing contracts:
#   1. A healthy lane, a transient retry, and an expired cap stay silent: the
#      descent never touches a worker that is making progress or may resume.
#   2. A quota-scale cap is proven through the REAL record helper
#      (bin/fm-opencode-retry.sh) fed the recorded vendor refusal below
#      ("Free usage exceeded, subscribe to Go [retrying in 21h 54m]", 78840s),
#      so the state machine is exercised against the refusal without spending
#      paid quota - plus the REAL busy writer (bin/fm-busy-event.sh) latching
#      session-retry, so a stale sidecar beside a resumed turn never moves a
#      worker.
#   3. A proven free cap relaunches the lane on Go through the control plane
#      (overridable for tests), verifies the durable record followed, clears
#      the dead session's sidecar, and says `relaunched`.
#   4. A Go-recorded cap, a secondmate, and a failed relaunch surface as
#      `refused`, exactly once per episode - the ladder has no third rung, a
#      persistent supervision agent is never auto-touched, and a broken move
#      is never retried blindly.
#   5. FM_OPENCODE_LADDER_OVERRIDE holds a capped worker where the captain put
#      it and says `override`, once per episode.
#   6. A move the record did not follow is reported as `unrecorded`, never as
#      a success.
#   7. An unbound cap on a free-recorded lane still relaunches, with the
#      ambiguity owned in the handoff note - the launch gate's own bias.
#   8. Off-ladder models are never governed, and the evaluation itself is
#      rate-limited off the watcher's poll.
