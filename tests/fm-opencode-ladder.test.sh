# Behavior tests for bin/fm-opencode-ladder-lib.sh - the free-then-Go ladder.
#
# The captain's rule: spend the FREE tier's own quota first each day, fall
# through to the paid Go tier only once free is proven exhausted, and climb
# back when free resets. Same model (muse spark 1.3), different provider
# prefix: opencode/muse-spark-1.3-contributor-free, then
# opencode-go/muse-spark-1.3-contributor.
#
# Where the agy ladder is predictive (it reads quota percentages before
# spending), this one is reactive: quota-axi reports nothing for opencode, so
# there is no reading to decide on. The only "free is exhausted" signal is the
# existing cap detection - bin/fm-opencode-retry.sh classifying the vendor's
# own retry-backoff horizon as quota-scale - and this ladder builds on it
# rather than re-deriving it.
#
# The load-bearing contracts:
#   1. A fresh home dispatches FREE by default, including a spawn that names
#      no model at all.
#   2. A free request with no proven cap stays on free, silently.
#   3. A free request with a proven quota-scale cap on the free tier falls
#      through to Go, and says so. The recorded vendor refusal below
#      ("Free usage exceeded, subscribe to Go [retrying in 21h 54m]") is the
#      text that case is built from: the test converts its horizon into the
#      vendor's own `next` timestamp through the real record helper, so the
#      state machine is exercised against the refusal without spending quota.
#   4. A seconds-long backoff (transient retry) never triggers the fall-through.
#   5. An expired cap climbs back to free on its own: the vendor's horizon is
#      the timer, via the record helper's own expiry.
#   6. A cap bound to the GO tier never moves a free request: the tiers are
#      separate quotas, so Go being capped says nothing about free.
#   7. An explicit Go request always stands, even while free is capped.
#   8. A model outside the governed pair launches unchanged, but reported.
#   9. FM_OPENCODE_LADDER_OVERRIDE holds a free request on free past a proven
#      cap, and SAYS SO. A silent override would be worse than no ladder.
#  10. A quota-scale cap with NO model binding still falls through: the
#      failure direction is deliberate (see the lib header), and the notice
#      says the evidence was unbound.
#  11. The gate sits on the ordinary dispatch path: a real bin/fm-spawn.sh
#      launch with a proven free cap carries the Go model id, and a real
#      launch with no model at all carries the free id - pinned through a
#      fake tmux pane, so no real harness ever starts.
