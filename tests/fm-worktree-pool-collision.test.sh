# Regression tests for pool-slot ownership across a task's whole life.
#
# A treehouse pool slot reads as free when no durable lease reserves it and no
# process is running inside it. Crewmate worktrees used to be taken with a bare
# `treehouse get`, which reserves nothing, so the slot was held only for as long
# as the AGENT lived. A task outlives its agent - through a dead endpoint, an
# awaited captain decision, or a finished run that has not been cleaned up - and
# the pool handed that task's directory to the next spawn. The first task's
# cleanup then reset the shared directory, deleted the branch checked out in it,
# and returned the slot, destroying the second task's work.
#
# These tests pin the invariant from both ends: a slot with a live claimant is
# never allocated into, and never returned.
