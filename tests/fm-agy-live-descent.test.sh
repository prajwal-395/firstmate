# tests/fm-agy-live-descent.test.sh - the regression for moving an ALREADY
# RUNNING agy worker along the ladder: down when its rung crosses its floor, and
# back up when a rung above it has reset clear of that floor.
#
# The launch gate (tests/fm-agy-ladder-enforcement.test.sh) covers a worker
# being STARTED. It cannot cover the failure this suite exists for: on
# 2026-08-20 a crewmate launched on rung 1 above the floor and then consumed
# Claude Opus 4.6 (Thinking) to zero during its run, which spent the captain's
# reserved quarter and left the worker stalled on an exhausted model. Nothing
# watched a run in progress.
#
# The load-bearing contracts:
#   1. A rung crossing its floor is detected from the SAME evidence and the SAME
#      policy the launch gate uses, never from a second copy of the rules.
#   2. The descent target is whatever bin/fm-agy-ladder-lib.sh authorizes, so
#      strict exhaustion still governs; a rung the gate refuses is never taken.
#   3. The rendered model picker is positively identified before a single
#      navigation key is sent, and every way of failing that identification
#      refuses.
#   4. The number of moves is parsed from the rendered list, never assumed, and
#      an ambiguous or absent target refuses instead of guessing.
#   5. A completed switch is believed only from BOTH independent signals agy
#      leaves behind. Losing either one must refuse - that is asserted by
#      driving the two apart deliberately.
#   6. The per-poll evaluation is silent and free for a healthy fleet, escalates
#      once rather than every minute, and refuses instead of acting whenever the
#      durable record and the running worker name different models. WHICH
#      SPELLING each side uses is not such a disagreement - agy accepts a kebab
#      id and a display name for the same model - so the two are reconciled
#      through agy's own catalogue, a catalogue that cannot be read refuses
#      rather than assuming agreement, and every refusal names the in-flight
#      protection it just took out rather than only the names that differed.
#   7. Climbing back up obeys the SAME floor: a running worker returns into the
#      free three quarters of rung 1 and never into the captain's reserved
#      quarter, and unlike a launch it needs positive evidence to move at all.
#   8. The climb's hysteresis holds. A rung oscillating across its boundary must
#      move the worker nowhere, which is the failure that kept this half out of
#      the descent's own change; both the dead band and the dwell are asserted
#      by driving a reading across the line and back repeatedly.
#   9. A confirmed move is written to the durable record before it is reported,
#      it REPLACES the model the record named rather than adding a second one,
#      and a move that cannot be recorded is escalated instead of announced as a
#      success - because recovery reads that record, so one still naming the
#      reserved rung would put the worker straight back onto it.
#  10. The reserve is enforced on the schedule of the worker SPENDING it, not on
#      firstmate's turn boundaries. A reading above the floor, a long gap with no
#      evaluation at all, then a reading below it must still move the worker, and
#      an agy worker's own turn end must be a driver that reaches the durable
#      queue with no watcher running.
#
# WHAT THIS SUITE DOES NOT PROVE. The picker's shape is a VENDOR fact, and the
# fixtures below are real agy 1.1.16 output captured in an isolated lab
# (docs/verification/agy-model-switch.md). This suite pins the classifier and
# the walk arithmetic against that output with no harness present, so CI
# enforces them everywhere. It cannot prove agy still draws that picker. That is
# what the opt-in live guard tests/fm-agy-model-switch-live-e2e.test.sh is for;
# run it after every agy upgrade.

# Enter, so the walk arithmetic is driven end to end against something that
# behaves like the picker rather than against a fixed screenshot.
#
# Its selection lives in FILES, not variables. The evaluation under test is
