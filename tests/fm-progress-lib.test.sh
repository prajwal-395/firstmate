#!/usr/bin/env bash
# tests/fm-progress-lib.test.sh - the positive progress measurement
# (bin/fm-progress-lib.sh) supervision uses instead of "the pane has not changed".
#
# The contract under test, and why each half exists:
#   1. TWO independent positive signals, either of which alone carries a
#      progressing verdict - accumulated CPU over the span, and a change in the
#      pane subtree's process membership. They are driven apart deliberately
#      below, and the divergence itself is asserted, so neither case can go
#      quietly vacuous if the other signal starts covering for it.
#   2. `stalled` requires a MATURE span with NEITHER signal. It is positive
#      evidence of non-progress and the only verdict allowed to raise a new
#      alarm.
#   3. Everything unreadable, immature, or nonsensical is `unknown`, never a
#      guess in either direction, and never resets a maturing baseline.
#
# Real processes, no harness: the subtree walk, the ps read, and the time parse
# are exercised against processes this test starts itself, while the verdict
# logic is exercised as a pure function over exact records so a threshold or
# span boundary is pinned to the byte rather than to a machine's timing.
