# Self-update a running firstmate and its secondmates to the latest tracked upstream.
#
# Mechanical half of the /updatefirstmate skill. Fast-forwards the running
# firstmate repo from its tracked upstream - its default branch when it owns its
# checkout, or its detached HEAD when the home is itself a leased worktree - then
# fast-forwards every registered secondmate home. Local homes are treehouse
# worktrees or standalone clones; remote routes update their configured code root
# on that host and then fast-forward the persistent home to that root.
# FAST-FORWARD ONLY, exactly like fm-fleet-sync.sh: never force, never create a
# merge commit, never stash; advance a target only when it is a clean
# fast-forward, otherwise skip and report. A tracked-files fast-forward never
# touches the gitignored operational dirs (data/, state/, config/, projects/,
# .no-mistakes/), so a secondmate's in-flight work is never disrupted. Worktrees
# of this repo share one object store, so a single fetch refreshes them all;
# standalone-clone homes are fetched on their own. Secondmate homes, and any
# firstmate home leased the same way, are held at a detached HEAD on the default
# branch, so a fast-forward there advances HEAD only and never touches any other
# worktree's checkout or the shared `main` branch.
#
# The fast-forward mechanics live in bin/fm-ff-lib.sh (base_mode "upstream" here);
# the same library drives the local-HEAD secondmate sync used by fm-spawn.sh and
# fm-bootstrap.sh, so there is one ff implementation, not several.
#
# It does NOT re-read AGENTS.md or nudge secondmates itself - those are LLM /
# tmux actions the skill performs. The script's job is the safe git mechanics
# plus a parseable summary telling the caller what to do next:
#   - one status line per target (updated/already current/skipped)
#   - reread-firstmate: yes|no    (did the running firstmate's instructions change)
#   - firstmate-changed-surface: <comma-list>|none   (which watched paths changed)
#   - firstmate-changed-files: <comma-list>|none   (which watched FILES changed)
#   - firstmate-changed-range: <before>..<after>|none   (the advance that changed them)
#   - nudge-secondmates: fm-<id>...|none   (updated live secondmates to nudge)
#   - nudge-surface fm-<id>: <comma-list>|unknown   (per-target changed paths)
#   - nudge-files fm-<id>: <comma-list>|unknown   (per-target changed FILES)
#   - nudge-range fm-<id>: <before>..<after>|unknown   (per-target advance)
#
# The changed-FILES lines exist so a nudge can name the surface a reader can
# check its own memory and assumptions against, instead of only asserting that
# something moved. They are capped to keep a nudge one sendable line and end in a
# "+N-more" element when truncated; the matching range line recovers the full set.
