# Single owner of a ship task's mode-specific "Definition of done" block and of
# the named-head reachability gate that accepts a ship `done:` claim.
# Sourced by bin/fm-brief.sh, which renders it into a generated ship brief, and by
# bin/fm-promote.sh, which renders it into the ship instructions a promoted scout
# receives. Both paths must hand the worker the same contract: a promoted
# no-mistakes worker that never received the ask-user escalation rule or the
# `--yes` ban is the exact delivery hole this single owner exists to close.
# fm_dod_block <no-mistakes|direct-PR|local-only> <task-id> [branch] [<forge>]
# prints the block on stdout with no trailing blank line. The caller validates the
# mode; an unknown mode is refused rather than silently rendered as the pipeline
# contract.
# The optional third argument is the task's full ship-branch name (a project's
# registered prefix may replace the legacy `fm/` one); it defaults to `fm/<task-id>`
# and is the immutable task branch rendered in every delivery contract.
# The optional fifth argument is the task's base branch from bin/fm-brief.sh
# --base-branch; empty means the repository default. A named base is the branch
# the worker starts from, never pushes to, and targets with its pull request, and
# fm_base_branch_valid refuses it where no pull request carries the work.
# Callers of the gate are bin/fm-crew-state.sh (current-state done),
# bin/fm-pr-check.sh (PR registration), and bin/fm-inactive-reconcile.sh
# (secondmate ledger-first publish of a child done). A ship `done:` is not
# accepted while the named head exists only in the worker's disposable copy.
# The check tests that head, not whether some branch moved. In no-mistakes
# mode the pre-validation `done: {summary}` is the pipeline handoff and is
# not gated; only the later CI-ready `done: PR <url> checks green` is, or on a
# Gerrit project the later `done: PR <change url> published for review`. The
# named head is the worker copy's HEAD, except that a done naming the task's
# recorded pr= passes when the forge holds that head: a forge-reported
# pr_head= in no-mistakes mode, or a recorded merge
# (state/<id>.pr-poll-merge-notified). A push to Gerrit's refs/for/ leaves no
# ref a fetch can see, so a done naming a Gerrit change skips the remote-tracking
# reachability test entirely: it passes when that change is already the task's
# recorded pr=, which bin/fm-pr-check.sh writes only after this gate accepted it
# at arming, and otherwise only when a live read shows the change's current
# patch set carrying the worker copy's HEAD tree. A published-for-review report
# whose URL is not a canonical Gerrit change is refused outright. A squash is a new commit on the
# server's base, so the tree rather than the commit is what names the published
# content. In no-mistakes mode that live read is preceded by
# fm_dod_nm_custody_returned: a copy that publishes before recovering the
# pipeline's fix commits agrees with its own unfixed patch set, so the copy must
# also hold the result of a passed run. These live reads are the one check at the ready
# decision; a later rebase or patch set on the server does not revoke an armed
# task's done. Teardown's landed-work test remains the complete discard gate.
# The block opens with the fixed machine-readable "Delivery contract: mode=<mode>"
# line that bin/fm-spawn.sh checks a ship brief against.
# This file is also the single owner of the brief scope-discipline contract
# (AGENTS.md section 11): `## Captain's intent` carries the captain's own ask
# and is treated as acceptance criteria, so it must not be widened into a
# general goal or an enumerated coverage list; `## Firstmate spec` carries only
# the build instructions that ask requires. bin/fm-brief.sh --check,
# bin/fm-spawn.sh, and bin/fm-promote.sh all gate through fm_brief_scope_check
# below, so the three never hold separate opinions about what a dispatchable
# brief is. The 2026-09-15 base reset removed the previous mechanism
# (fm-brief-lib.sh with its four scope fields); this contract is re-implemented
# here against the current two-subsection scaffold instead of reverted, because
# the scaffold moved under it. The full-suite-run rule is deliberately not part
# of this gate: related, separate, and not asked for.
# The gate refuses shapes, never quality, in the same fail-closed spirit as the
# placeholder and content backstops above. An enumerated coverage list in the
# intent is refused at three or more list items: one or two items can be the
# ask's own structure, while three is the coverage-list shape of a widened ask.
# A spec line is refused only when it carries a sweep shape from the closed set
# below (the generalization / consistency-sweep / extra-hardening shapes the
# contract names) without a prohibition or out-of-scope cue on the same line:
# "Do NOT sweep the repo" is the guardrail working, not the defect.
# Deliberately not caught: a brief that broadens the ask in plain prose with
# neither list nor sweep shape ("make the pipeline robust while you are there").
# Judging that would refuse legitimate briefs, and prose breadth is firstmate
# judgment at intake, not a mechanical verdict. The limits are stated here so
# they are on the record rather than discovered later.
# A refusal always points the same way the captain did on 2026-09-05 ("at least
# if you have a problem escalate it to me"): narrow the brief to the ask, and
# carry the wider scope as follow-up work or escalate it, rather than widening
# the ask here.
# This file is also the one owner of the never-upstream PR-target rule: the
# PR-creating modes carry the fork target automatically, so every ship brief and
# every promoted scout receives it from the scaffold rather than from whoever
# writes the brief remembering it. The mechanical refusal lives in
# bin/fm-pr-lib.sh and is enforced by bin/fm-pr-check.sh and bin/fm-pr-merge.sh.
# The string passed must be self-sufficient - it plus the codebase reconstructs
# roughly the same specification - so a report, decision, or PR the intent
# refers to is written into it as substance, never left as a pointer.
# bin/fm-brief.sh scaffolds those two `# Task` subsections; bin/fm-spawn.sh and
# bin/fm-promote.sh refuse leftover `{TASK}` / `{FIRSTMATE_SPEC}` placeholders
# and a `## Captain's intent` line opening with a Captain label or address
# through the helpers below. Other mentions of `--intent` point here rather than
# restating the rule.
# Every heredoc here stays outside a command substitution: `VAR=$(cat <<EOF ...)`
# breaks parsing of the whole file on Bash 3.2 (tests/fm-brief.test.sh).
# fm_brief_worker_role owns the ship/scout role scope. bin/fm-spawn.sh is its one
# emitter, supplying it first in every ship/scout launch brief and never to a
# secondmate charter. It names the one task-owned steering inbox without
# relaxing isolation from every other home's endpoint namespace. Like
# fm_brief_intent_overlay it is a distinctly titled launch section that states
# its own precedence, so a brief or project instruction that authors a
# conflicting role is superseded rather than duplicated.
# The code root argument is the Firstmate checkout that holds
# .agents/skills/firstmate-coding-guidelines/SKILL.md. A worker in a Firstmate
# worktree loads that skill by name from its own checkout. A worker whose
# session does not register the skill, such as one in another project's
# worktree, cannot, so the role also names the file as the fallback to read;
# the Claude launch grants the skills directory that holds it.
# fm_ship_rule_one owns the mode-specific first ship safety rule shared by an
# ordinary ship brief and the durable contract written during scout promotion.
# It takes the same optional trailing forge argument, because the rule that keeps
# a worker off a remote is exactly the rule that changes when the forge does.

This task ships **direct-PR**: you raise the PR yourself, without the no-mistakes pipeline.
The task is complete only when committed on your branch.
When it is implemented and committed, push your branch and open a PR with \`gh-axi\`, then look at the PR's check rollup before reporting done.
When this task works on the firstmate repo, that PR targets the fork, never upstream: pass \`-R prajwal-395/firstmate\` on every PR command, and read the returned URL back before reporting it.
The fleet refuses any PR against \`kunchenguid/firstmate\` under the captain's standing never-upstream ruling, and no brief prose overrides that refusal.
When the PR has checks, wait until every check reaches a completed conclusion: all green means append \`done: PR {url} checks complete\` and stop; any failure means diagnose and fix on the same branch, push, and wait for the next verdict, repeating until green. A conflicting branch is not a verdict - resolve it first and wait on the new head.
When the repo runs no checks for the PR (no workflow in \`.github/workflows\` fires on pull requests for this branch), there is no verdict to wait for.
Run the affected test suites and lint yourself before reporting.
Then append \`done: PR {url} tests <passed>/<total> lint <clean|failed> sha <sha>\` with the counts you saw and the commit sha you ran them against, and stop.
Never wait on checks that do not exist.

Firstmate will then instruct you to run /no-mistakes to validate and ship a PR.

You drive no-mistakes by responding to its gates, not by implementing fixes.
Follow the guidance no-mistakes itself provides for the mechanics: it loads when you invoke /no-mistakes, and \`no-mistakes axi run --help\` plus the \`help\` lines in each \`axi\` response are authoritative and version-matched to the installed binary.
When starting no-mistakes, pass \`--intent\` as only this brief's \`## Captain's intent\` subsection body, not its heading, plus any later words the captain actually said.
Preserve the actual words without adding speaker labels or direct address; the subsection heading supplies provenance outside the pipeline input.
For a legacy brief with no such subsection, include only words on lines marked \`[captain] \`, excluding that metadata prefix; never copy its mixed \`# Task\` wholesale.
If it has no provenance-marked captain words, stop and ask firstmate instead of starting no-mistakes.
Do not include \`## Firstmate spec\`, later Firstmate build constraints, or your own decisions and tradeoffs.
The \`--intent\` string you pass must be self-sufficient: that string plus the codebase must let a reader reconstruct roughly the same specification, without depending on a separate report, a PR, or context that lives only in this conversation.
When the captain's intent refers to a report, decision, or PR ("do items 1, 2, 3, and 7 of the report"), write the substance of the referenced items into \`--intent\` in the captain's terms, not only the pointer; that substance is the captain's ask by reference, while Firstmate's build instructions and your own decisions still stay out.
This replaces the no-mistakes skill's advice to enrich \`--intent\` with decisions and tradeoffs; that advice does not apply to Firstmate-dispatched work.
Do not hand-edit, commit, or fix findings yourself while a run is active - the pipeline applies every fix.

$drive_block
A killed or timed-out call is never evidence the daemon died: the daemon accepts your response immediately and runs the round in the background, so the call was only ever waiting for a read while the run kept working.
Reattach and keep going rather than reporting the pipeline blocked; rule 7 owns the checks that decide when a pipeline block is real.

Two firstmate-specific rules layer on top of that guidance:
- ask-user findings are never yours to answer: escalate to firstmate using rule 6's ask-user format and stop.
  Firstmate applies \`ask-user-authority\` and obtains any required captain decision.
  When the decision comes back, feed it to the gate with \`no-mistakes axi respond\` and let the pipeline apply it - do not route the question to "the user" or implement the fix yourself.
- NEVER pass \`--yes\` (or \`-y\`) to \`no-mistakes axi run\` or \`no-mistakes axi respond\`. It is banned fleet-wide.
  It auto-resolves every gate including ask-user findings with no escalation, and answering your own ask-user finding is a hard rule violation.

After /no-mistakes reports CI green (the CI-ready return point - do not wait for it to keep monitoring in the background until merge), append \`done: PR {url} checks green\` and stop. You are finished.
When this task works on the firstmate repo, that PR must target the fork \`prajwal-395/firstmate\`, never upstream \`kunchenguid/firstmate\`: read the returned URL back before reporting it, and if it names the upstream repo, append \`blocked: PR targets upstream, not the fork\` instead of done.
The fleet refuses any PR against \`kunchenguid/firstmate\` under the captain's standing never-upstream ruling, and no brief prose overrides that refusal.
