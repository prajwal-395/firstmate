# fm-opencode-descent-lib.sh - keep an ALREADY RUNNING opencode worker on the
# free-then-Go ladder.
# Usage: . bin/fm-opencode-descent-lib.sh
# Sourced by bin/fm-watch.sh. Defining functions is all this file does; the
# only things it pulls in on its own are the libraries below, and only when a
# caller has not already loaded them.
#
# THE HALF THE DISPATCH GATE CANNOT COVER. bin/fm-opencode-ladder-lib.sh routes
# the NEXT spawn and never looks at a lane again. A lane that starts on free
# and hits the cap mid-run does not fail: the vendor holds the session in
# `retry` and re-schedules it for hours (the 2026-09-07 twelve-lane stall),
# while supervision reads the lane as working for the whole backoff. This file
# is the re-evaluation the ladder was missing, on the watcher's own cadence,
# against the same cap evidence the dispatch gate uses - and it reuses
# bin/fm-opencode-retry.sh as that detector rather than writing a second one.
#
# THE HINGE QUESTION, ANSWERED WITH EVIDENCE. PR 96 declined to move running
# workers for lack of a verified in-session model switch. Re-verified on
# opencode 1.18.29, that is still true, in both directions:
#
#   - The TUI has an interactive `/models` picker (Select model, Search/Recent
#     rows, esc to close - driven live in a scratch pane with no prompt ever
#     submitted, so zero quota spent). It lists both ladder tiers, so a human
#     can switch mid-session. But it is a rendered picker with no verified
#     walk: row order comes from the account catalogue, and no confirmation
#     signals have been proven. Driving it unsupervised would risk parking a
#     live worker on the wrong model with no proven gain.
#   - Upstream confirms there is no programmatic path either: issue #24006
#     (runtime model switching via plugin API) is closed not_planned, the
#     `chat.params` hook output carries temperature/topP/topK/maxOutputTokens
#     but no model, and the plugin event reference (opencode.ai/docs/plugins,
#     2026-09-08) lists observer-style events plus a per-tool
#     `tool.execute.before` deny - which gates one tool while the loop keeps
#     spending, exactly the insufficiency bin/fm-agy-descent-lib.sh documents
#     for agy's own deny primitive.
#
# So the honest move is not an in-session switch but the verified control-plane
# relaunch: bin/fm-control.sh relaunch --model is transactional, keeps the same
# worktree, branch, commits, and brief, and carries a handoff note because the
# replacement inherits the local copy but none of the conversation. A capped
# lane is parked doing nothing, so ending its session loses no in-flight work
# beyond context the replacement re-derives from the brief and the commits.
# That is a heavier act than agy's conversation-preserving switch, which is
# why every move below is reported as a wake the supervisor sees.
#
# THE TRIGGER IS THE SUPERVISION-GRADE VERDICT, NOT JUST THE SIDECAR. The
# dispatch gate scans sidecars alone; a relaunch destroys a session, so this
# evaluation additionally requires the busy latch bin/fm-crew-state.sh owns:
# the record must read busy, from the opencode plugin, on the latched
# session-retry event. A stale sidecar beside a resumed turn (which writes
# session-busy first) therefore never moves a worker. The composition is
# restated here rather than calling into bin/fm-crew-state.sh because that
# file is a main script with no source guard; both owners it composes -
# bin/fm-busy-lib.sh and bin/fm-opencode-retry.sh - are called, not copied.
#
# WHAT MOVES, AND WHAT ONLY SURFACES. A lane recorded on the free tier with a
# proven cap relaunches onto Go, including when the cap evidence carries no
# model binding - the dispatch gate's own throughput-first bias, with the
# handoff note owning the ambiguity. Three cases surface as `refused` instead:
# a lane recorded on Go (the ladder has no third rung), a secondmate
# (automatic relaunch never touches a persistent supervision agent), and a
# lane recording no model at all (refusing to move blind). Off-ladder models
# are never governed and stay silent. A move the durable record did not follow
# is reported as `unrecorded`, never claimed. Each episode gets exactly one
# automatic attempt: unlike agy's switch, every attempt here stops a live
# worker, so a failed move is surfaced rather than retried, and the refusal
# wake hands the retry to firstmate with full context.
#
# THERE IS NO CLIMB-BACK FOR RUNNING WORKERS, BY DESIGN. A healthy lane on Go
# is making progress; moving it back to free would risk its conversation for
# zero gain, and new spawns already climb back through the dispatch gate the
# moment the vendor's horizon elapses. The descent is one-directional: free
# onto Go, never Go onto free.
#
# THE WATCHER IS THE ONLY DRIVER, AND THAT IS SUFFICIENT. agy needed a
# turn-end driver because a worker inside one long turn keeps spending while
# the watcher waits between firstmate's turns. A capped opencode lane spends
# nothing - the vendor parked it - so there is no spend to race, and a capped
# lane never reaches a turn end that could drive anything. The watcher's poll
# is the only evaluation, rate-limited by FM_OPENCODE_DESCENT_INTERVAL, and it
# costs local file reads only: no quota subprocess exists for opencode.
#
# NO POINT-OF-SPEND GATE EXISTS FOR OPENCODE, AND NONE IS FAKED HERE. agy's
# gate works because agy invokes it PostInvocation inside the worker's own
# loop AND because quota evidence exists to decide on before the floor is
# crossed. opencode has neither half: no hook ends the agent loop (see the
# surface above), and no pre-spend evidence exists anywhere (quota-axi answers
# "unsupported provider"; the Go plan has no public usage API). The retry
# event fires after the refusal, when the vendor has already parked the
# session - gating there would be polling pretending to be synchronous, which
# the brief forbids. This evaluation plus the sidecar detector is the whole
# of the opencode ladder's running-worker enforcement.
#
# THE FAILURE DIRECTION, STATED NOT IMPLIED. A wrong relaunch restarts a
# conversation whose work products (worktree, commits, brief, note) are all
# preserved; a missed cap stalls the lane for roughly a day. This file is
# biased toward relaunching, for the captain's own throughput-first reason.
#
# THE OVERRIDE. FM_OPENCODE_LADDER_OVERRIDE is the launch gate's deliberate
# escape and it is honoured here too: a worker held on free past a proven cap
# on the captain's explicit request is not dragged off it behind their back.
# Its use is printed, exactly as the launch gate prints it. bin/fm-spawn.sh
# records the override per task where this evaluation reads it back, because
# the variable itself never reaches the watcher: the watcher is a long-lived
# process that predates the instruction.
#
# FM_OPENCODE_DESCENT=off disables the whole evaluation, leaving the dispatch
# gate as the only enforcement. In production the off state is filed as
# <state-dir>/.opencode-descent-off, which the watcher reads: the variable
# alone never reaches it, for the same reason. The variable stays as an
# additional source for one-shot runs and the regression suite.
# FM_OPENCODE_DESCENT_CONTROL_BIN overrides the
# control-plane binary the relaunch runs through; production leaves it at the
# default, tests point it at a stub so no real agent is ever stopped.
