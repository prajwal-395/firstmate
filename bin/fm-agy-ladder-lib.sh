# fm-agy-ladder-lib.sh - the agy model ladder, enforced at the dispatch layer.
# Usage: . bin/fm-agy-ladder-lib.sh
# Sourced by bin/fm-spawn.sh. This file has no side effects on source beyond
# pulling in its own quota-reading dependency and loading the ladder from config.
#
# THE POLICY. The captain's standing rule for agy dispatch is a fixed three-rung
# ladder run by STRICT EXHAUSTION, not load balancing.
# The rung order is DERIVED from config/crew-dispatch.json's "default" array,
# which is the one place the captain sets it.
# When the config file is absent (a fresh home, a test), the built-in default
# order applies.
#
# Work runs on the highest non-exhausted rung. A lower rung is valid only once
# EVERY rung above it is exhausted, and work climbs straight back the moment a
# rung above resets. The exhaustion floor is a property of the MODEL, not the
# rung position: Claude Opus 4.6 (Thinking) stops at 25 percent remaining
# wherever it sits on the ladder, because that last quarter is reserved for the
# captain on explicit request and automatic dispatch never touches it. Every
# other model exhausts to 0.
#
# This file gates LAUNCHES. bin/fm-agy-descent-lib.sh applies the same rule, in
# both directions, to a worker already running, by putting each candidate rung
# to the gate below rather than keeping rungs or floors of its own.
#
# The authoritative statement of the policy is the captain-private
# config/crew-dispatch.json "_ladder_note"; this file is its enforcement, not a
# second copy of it. The rung order derives from that config's "default" array
# at load time, so a reorder there is a reorder here with no second edit.
#
# WHY A GATE AND NOT PROSE. The ladder used to live only in instructions, so
# every dispatch depended on an agent remembering it. The captain asked for it
# to be enforced in tooling instead (2026-08-16: "i don't think its currently
# strictly enforced so it is something i want you to enforce"). This library is
# the decision; bin/fm-spawn.sh is where it is applied, which is the single
# path every crewmate and scout launch already takes, so an ordinary dispatch
# cannot route around it.
#
# THE EVIDENCE. quota-axi does not model agy at all, so agy answers for itself.
# bin/fm-agy-quota-lib.sh owns every part of that: the live intake poll this
# gate runs at dispatch time, the opportunistic pane-footer reading
# bin/fm-watch.sh records, the format both write, and the freshness rule that
# ages a reading out. The percentage is the SESSION-WINDOW quota, which is the
# only thing that governs a rung; a transient per-minute or per-request throttle
# is not exhaustion and never appears here.
#
# WHY THE POLL IS PART OF THE GATE. One `agy --print /quota` call answers EVERY
# model at once, and this gate needs exactly that, because it makes two
# decisions and they lean on different rungs:
#
#   - Is the requested rung above its own floor? That needs the requested rung.
#   - Is it the HIGHEST available rung? That needs every rung above it.
#
# Before the poll, evidence refreshed only when a live agy pane happened to
# redraw, so a home with no agy pane running had none. That did not merely fail
# the floor open. It ALSO blocked every descent, because a descent is refused
# unless the rungs above are proven exhausted - so rung 1 launched unchecked
# below its floor while rung 2 was refused for lack of proof, and dispatch
# escaped the ladder upward to a more expensive model outside it entirely. The
# fix for both halves is the same fresh reading, which is why the poll runs once
# here, ahead of both decisions, rather than beside either one.
#
# Readings are per-home, because state/ is. The quota itself is per-account, so
# a secondmate that has never drawn an agy pane of its own knows nothing about
# the rungs even while the primary home does. That resolves to rung 1 under the
# rule below, which is the right answer anyway: a home with no evidence starts
# at the top of the ladder rather than assuming somebody else spent it - and the
# poll above then gives it the account's own current figures before it decides,
# so no home decides on another home's staleness.
#
# THE ASYMMETRY, WHICH IS THE WHOLE DESIGN. Quota evidence can still be absent
# after the poll: agy may not be installed, jq may be missing, the call may time
# out, or the account may report no quota summary. The captain ruled on
# 2026-08-19 that this must not stop work - "we should not allow the fleet to
# stall" - so absence is never a refusal to launch at the top. Nor is it a
# licence to descend. Absence is resolved by direction of travel:
#
#   - Climbing or staying at the top needs no evidence. Rung 1 is the ladder's
#     first choice anyway, and no rung sits above it to exhaust. That is a rule
#     about STARTING there. Moving an already-running worker back UP is a
#     different move - it spends the reserve rather than merely declining to
#     descend - so bin/fm-agy-descent-lib.sh requires positive evidence for it,
#     plus hysteresis, and it reaches that decision by asking this gate about
#     each candidate rung rather than by keeping a floor of its own.
#   - DESCENDING needs positive evidence. A lower rung is refused unless every
#     rung above it has a current reading that proves it exhausted. Descending
#     is exactly the move the policy exists to constrain, so an unknown rung
#     above blocks it rather than excusing it.
#   - A rung's OWN floor refuses only on positive evidence. An unknown reading
#     for the requested rung is not proof it is spent, and treating it as such
#     would wedge the fleet for the same reason as above.
#
# WHEN THE POLL ITSELF IS UNAVAILABLE, that asymmetry is what the gate falls
# back to, and it says which of the two it did. Rung 1 still launches, so agy
# work never stalls; a descent is still refused, because nothing proved the rung
# above spent. The refusal names the failed live read rather than reporting a
# bare absence, so the reader can tell "never observed" from "could not reach
# agy just now" and reaches for FM_AGY_LADDER_OVERRIDE instead of quietly
# abandoning the ladder for a costlier model outside it.
#
# HEADROOM FOR LAUNCHES IN FLIGHT. A reading describes the account at the moment
# it was taken, so concurrent launches are invisible to it and a burst at 26%
# could all clear a 25% floor before any of them was counted. Each authorized
# launch is recorded, and FM_AGY_LADDER_INFLIGHT_MARGIN percentage points are
# reserved per launch still unreflected in the reading. The comparison is
# against that reserved figure, not the bare reading. That ledger is scoped to
# the AGY ACCOUNT and not to this home, so the launches it counts are every
# home's on this machine; bin/fm-agy-quota-lib.sh owns that scope, what it does
# and does not reach, and why. fm_agy_ladder_gate below records the reservation
# itself, under the same lock it decides on.
#
# OFF-LADDER MODELS. agy offers models the ladder does not name (Gemini 3.1 Pro
# (Low), Claude Sonnet 4.6, GPT-OSS 120B, and so on), and a launch with no
# --model at all lets agy pick its own. The ladder governs the three rungs; it
# does not silently extend to models the captain never ranked, so those launches
# are ALLOWED - but they are reported, because an unranked model is also the
# obvious way to end up outside the policy without noticing.
#
# THE OVERRIDE. FM_AGY_LADDER_OVERRIDE, set to a non-empty reason, turns any
# refusal into a launch and prints what it overrode. It is an environment
# variable rather than a flag deliberately: config/crew-dispatch.json profiles
# carry only harness, model, and effort, so a routine profile-driven dispatch
# has no way to express it, and reaching the captain's reserved last quarter of
# Opus 4.6 stays a deliberate act at the command line.

# Resolve this library's own directory so it can pull in the quota reader
# whether it was sourced by a bin/ script or directly by a test.

# --- the ladder: derived from config, not restated ---------------------------
#
# THE ORDER comes from config/crew-dispatch.json's "default" array, which is the
# single place the captain sets the rung sequence. This file reads it once at
# load time and derives the enforcement tables from it, so a reorder there takes
# effect here with no second edit - the one-owner rule.
#
# THE FLOOR is a property of the MODEL, not of the rung position. When the
# captain moved Opus from rung 1 to rung 2, the 25 percent reserve must travel
# with the model rather than staying pinned to whatever rung number it used to
# occupy. _FM_LADDER_MODEL_FLOOR is the table, keyed by display name.
#
# THE KEBAB IDS are the alternative spellings agy accepts for each display name.
# They are properties of the model catalogue, not of the order, and cannot be
# derived mechanically from a display name (e.g. "4.6" becomes "4-6" in Claude
# but stays "3.1" in Gemini). _fm_agy_ladder_kebab_to_display is that map, and
# _fm_agy_ladder_is_known_display is the set it draws from; both are stated
# once, as arms of a case, so the two spellings of one model cannot drift.
#
# When the config file is absent - a fresh home, a secondmate that has not been
# seeded, a test that does not set FM_AGY_LADDER_CONFIG - the built-in default
# order applies. That default matches the captain's current order so a fleet
# that has never had the config is correct by default.

# fm_agy_ladder_gate: fm_agy_ladder_check with the captain override applied, the

# model, a used override, or a refusal.

#
# DECIDING AND RESERVING ARE ONE STEP, and that is why the reservation lives
# here rather than in bin/fm-spawn.sh where it used to. Between a gate that had
# decided and a caller that had not yet recorded, the reading both leaned on
# said the same thing to everyone, so two launches an instant apart could each
# be told they were the only one. Holding the account's reservation lock across
# the decision and the record closes that window instead of narrowing it, and
# because the lock and the ledger are scoped to the AGY ACCOUNT rather than to
# this home (bin/fm-agy-quota-lib.sh owns why), it closes it between homes too -
# which is the case that actually cost the captain the reserve on 2026-09-02.
#
# THE LOCK IS BOUNDED AND FAILING TO GET IT IS NOT A REFUSAL. bin/fm-spawn.sh
# calls this while holding its own spawn locks, so waiting indefinitely on
# another home would let one wedged home stall the whole fleet's dispatch. When
# the lock does not come, the decision is still made against the same shared
# ledger - every home's launches, not just this home's - and the reservation is
# still recorded. Only the serialization is lost.
#
# THE POLL STAYS OUTSIDE THE LOCK. It is the multi-second part, it reads the
# account rather than the ledger, and two homes polling at once is simply two
# reads of the same external truth.
